This book by Lisbeth Kaiser teaches

life of Rosa Parks, the civil rights

1955, she courageously refused to

Growing up in an upper-class family, Florence Nightingale 
was expected to find a husband and live a life of luxury — 
but that kind of life wasn’t for her. Her calling was caring 
for the sick and the poor, so she followed her passion with 
her whole heart and trained to be a nurse. When war broke 
out, Florence traveled to nurse wounded soldiers but found 
that the hospitals were so dirty that they were making 
people ill! This experience inspired her to lead a healthcare 
revolution, and she became the mother of modern nursing, 
introducing care practices still followed today." onmouseover="this.width=155;this.height=185;" style="cursor: pointer;" onmouseout="this.width=160;this.height=190" width="160" height="190"></a></td>
